# Console
Implementation of popular algorithms and data structures using .NET Core

## Getting Started
Prerequisites:
* Install the latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [Visual Studio](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads)
* Get the code:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Miltt/Console.git
